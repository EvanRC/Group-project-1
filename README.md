## Outdoor Adventures

# As outdoor adventuers, we want to go out in nature
# So we will want to what times of the year would be best dependent on geographical location/activity/weather during said time of year
# So WE will create an app that allows us to view the weather, location (gps milage dependent on current location), times of year it is open ect. to see when it would be best to visit the park.
# Also we can also allow for an activity based filter to get the best results closest to you
# WE will use openweather API
# WE will use the National Parks API
